machine learning labs and projects (4/17/23 - 6/7/23)

each lab and project delves into jupyter notebook and python and goes through various machine learning concepts

lab 1: learn python syntax and how to deal with different datastructures such as
lists, sets, arrays, dictionaries
also practice with importing various python libraries such as pandas and numpy
experiemnt with different ways of extracting and analyzing data

lab 2: learn to extract features from data, practice with creating matrices

lab 3: practice with importing the sklearn library, use k-nearest neighbor algorithm as well as various
encoding techniques to learn to practice data classification and prediction
practice using accuracy and f1 score to analyze results

lab 4: practice with multivariate linear regression and gradients
use root mean squared error to analyze results

lab 5: use logistic regression, learn how dimensionality reduction can help clarify data
practice with importing libraries with functions to assist with reducing dimensionality

lab 6: use ensemble methods such as decision tree and random forest to analyze data, ultimately forming a classifier
data points are divided into train and test, and the quality of our classifiers is analyzed by running them on the test entries
we also practice with an ensemble of ensembles which can help combine multiple ensembles with a majority voting system
in order to achieve even better results
