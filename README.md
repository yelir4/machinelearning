machine learning labs and projects (4/17/23 - 6/7/23)

each lab and project delves into jupyter notebook and python and goes through various machine learning concepts

lab 1: learn python syntax and how to deal with different datastructures such as
lists, sets, arrays, dictionaries
also practice with importing various python libraries such as pandas and numpy
experiemnt with different ways of extracting and analyzing data

lab 2: learn to extract features from data, practice with creating matrices

lab 3: practice with importing the sklearn library, use k-nearest neighbor algorithm as well as various
encoding techniques to learn to practice data classification and prediction
practice using accuracy and f1 score to analyze results

lab 4: practice with multivariate linear regression and gradients
use root mean squared error to analyze results

lab 5: use logistic regression, learn how dimensionality reduction can help clarify data
practice with importing libraries with functions to assist with reducing dimensionality

lab 6: use ensemble methods such as decision tree and random forest to analyze data, ultimately forming a classifier
data points are divided into train and test, and the quality of our classifiers is analyzed by running them on the test entries
we also practice with an ensemble of ensembles which can help combine multiple ensembles with a majority voting system
in order to achieve even better results

lab 7: practice with k-means algorithm to solve clustering problems within data
practice with graphing data and visually intuiting where the clusters may be and compare this with the performance of the clustering algorithms
practice with different techniques such as bisecting k-means and tuning hyperparameters to achieve more accurate results

lab 8: use k-nearest neighbors as a clustering method as well as implementing other libraries and tuning hyperparameters
more practice with pre-processing and cleaning up data before performing on it

lab 9: practice with association analysis and finding similarities within quantitative or qualitative data
practice with generating frequent itemsets and using these as intermediate analysis tools
practice with ECLAT and fpgrowth libraries and compare their association analysis processes

lab 10: practice with neural networks to predict numbers based on handwriting
makes use of various processes such as mini-batch gradient descent and optimizer steps,
using loss and other criteria to determine accuracy

pr1: use nearest neighbor as a classifier on data to assign classes to short text
evaluate results using f1-scoring metric
practice with using file readers/writers in python and discerning meaningful results in the output

pr2: practice with various regression models to determine the greatest performing regression model on given dataset
data is imbalanced so start with some form of dimensionality reduction

pr3: practice with using clustering techniques to form classes within a dataset
use hyperparamters to optimize the clustering algorithm
